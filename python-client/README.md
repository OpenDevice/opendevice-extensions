python-client
=====
This is a library in python that used to connect to OpenDevice (using Tcp)


Current status
--------------

python-client is still very much a work in progress. Please don't go use it just yet for anything serious. The public API can change without notice. However, we're interested in feedback, so we invite you to play with it!

The main purpose of developing this library was to integrate with blender, [take a look](https://github.com/OpenDevice/opendevice-examples/tree/master/opendevice-3d-blender)
